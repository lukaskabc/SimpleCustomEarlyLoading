This _mod_ allows the customization of **Neoforge's** early loading screen.

There is also a quite "hacky" version for **Forge** `1.20.1, 1.20.2, 1.20.4, 1.20.6`.  
I do not plan to continue in supporting other Forge versions due to technical reasons.  
**For newer versions, please use the NeoForge.**
See forge version description: [Releases](https://github.com/lukaskabc/SimpleCustomEarlyLoading/releases).

![Preview](./preview.png)

Currently, the window is not able to dynamically change its resolution when the window is resized.  
I won't allow removing the Mojang logo.

## Features:

- add and position **custom images** (see [supported image formats](#supported-image-formats))
- toggle and change the position of the progress bar
- toggle performance bar
- toggle NeoForge's fox
- toggle bottom left log
- toggle NeoForge's version (bottom right)

## Supported image formats:

**Animated images:**

- **APNG** - must be created without unchanged pixels detection (each frame is rendered from scratch).
  The animation will respect the image timing and repeat count.

**Static images:**

- JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib
- PNG 1/2/4/8/16-bit-per-channel
- TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
- BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
- PSD (composited view only, no extra channels, 8/16 bit-per-channel)
- GIF (renders only single static frame, use APNG instead)
- HDR (radiance rgbE format)
- PIC (Softimage PIC)
- PNM (PPM and PGM binary only)

## Installation - NeoForge:

1. place the jar in the mods folder
2. modify the `config/fml.toml` file

```toml
# Early window provider
earlyWindowProvider = "SimpleCustomEarlyLoading"
# ... Other options ...
# Optionally set the window to be maximized
earlyWindowMaximized = true
```

## Installation - Forge:

1. place the jar in the mods folder
2. forge version requires default `config/fml.toml` value

```toml
#Early window provider
earlyWindowProvider = "fmlearlywindow"
```

Unfortunately, the override is applied quite late,
which may result in the original red early loading (or a white screen) to "flash" on the very game start.
I can't do anything about that.

However, the red color of the original loading can be changed to black using

3. Optional: update `options.txt` file: `darkMojangStudiosBackground:true`

## Configuration:

Place your images in the `config/simple_custom_early_loading` folder.

Then you can edit the configuration file `config/simple-custom-early-loading.json`.  
You can find default
config [here](https://github.com/lukaskabc/SimpleCustomEarlyLoading/blob/main/src/main/resources/default_config.json).

In the configuration you can specify elements.
Each element is one image in a supported format.
The element needs to have a position specified.

First you define the `position_anchor` which specifies which part of the image is aligned with the x and y coordinates.
For example, `TOP_LEFT` means, that top left corner of the image will be aligned to the x and y coordinates.
Possible values are: `TOP_LEFT`, `TOP_RIGHT`, `BOTTOM_LEFT`, `BOTTOM_RIGHT`, `CENTER`, `TOP_CENTER`, `BOTTOM_CENTER`,
`LEFT_CENTER`, `RIGHT_CENTER`.
You can see the specifications in
the [ElementAnchor enum](./src/main/java/cz/lukaskabc/minecraft/mod_loader/loading/simple_custom_early_loading/config/element_anchor/ElementAnchor.java).

`position_unit` specifies the type of coordinates for `x` and `y` coordinates.
`PIXELS` means that coordinates are absolute pixels in the window.
`PERCENTAGE` means that coordinates are percentage of the window size.
E.g. `x=50` and `y=50` means that the image anchor will be positioned in the middle of the window.

It is also possible to specify the position units for each coordinate separately.
(`position_unit_x`, `position_unit_y`)

`x` and `y` coordinates specify the position of the image anchor in the position units.

`width` and `height` specify the size of the image on the screen.

`size_unit` specifies the unit for the width and height parameters (again `PIXELS` or `PERCENTAGE`).
Percentage values are calculated from the window size.

You can specify only one parameter, either `width` or `height` and the second will be calculated from the aspect ratio
of the image.

The default config contains an example of background (stretched to the whole window) -
it is a screenshot from the game with the [stellarview](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView) mod.  
Second element is an APNG animation created with [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/)
with [text generator plugin](https://www.blockbench.net/plugins/mc_text_generator)
and [ScreenToGif application](https://www.screentogif.com/).

For creating APNG animations, I recommend using [ScreenToGif application](https://www.screentogif.com/).
During export, you need to **uncheck** the "Detect unchanged pixels" option.

# Development

This is a simplified version of [StargateEarlyLoading mod](https://github.com/lukaskabc/StargateEarlyLoading).
