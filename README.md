This _mod_ allows the customization of **Neoforge's** early loading screen.

There is also a quite "hacky" version for **Forge** `1.20.1, 1.20.2, 1.20.4, 1.20.6`.  
I do not plan to continue in supporting other Forge versions due to technical reasons.  
**For newer versions, please use the NeoForge.**
See forge version description: [Releases](https://github.com/lukaskabc/SimpleCustomEarlyLoading/releases).

Currently, the window is not able to dynamically change its resolution when the window is resized.  
I won't allow removing the Mojang logo.

## Features:

- add and position **custom images** (see [supported image formats](#supported-image-formats))
- toggle and change the position of the progress bar
- toggle performance bar
- toggle NeoForge's fox
- toggle bottom left log
- toggle NeoForge's version (bottom right)

## Supported image formats:

**Animated images:**

- APNG

**Static images:**

- JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib
- PNG 1/2/4/8/16-bit-per-channel
- TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
- BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
- PSD (composited view only, no extra channels, 8/16 bit-per-channel)
- GIF (renders only single static frame, use APNG instead)
- HDR (radiance rgbE format)
- PIC (Softimage PIC)
- PNM (PPM and PGM binary only)

## Installation - NeoForge:

1. place the jar in the mods folder
2. modify the `config/fml.toml` file

```toml
# Early window provider
earlyWindowProvider = "SimpleCustomEarlyLoading"
# ... Other options ...
# Optionally set the window to be maximized
earlyWindowMaximized = true
```

## Installation - Forge:

1. place the jar in the mods folder
2. forge version requires default `config/fml.toml` value

```toml
#Early window provider
earlyWindowProvider = "fmlearlywindow"
```

Unfortunately, the override is applied quite late,
which may result in the original red early loading (or a white screen) to "flash" on the very game start.
I can't do anything about that.

However, the red color of the original loading can be changed to black using

3. Optional: update `options.txt` file: `darkMojangStudiosBackground:true`

## Configuration:

Place your images in the `config/simple_custom_early_loading` folder.

Then you can edit the configuration file `config/simple-custom-early-loading.json`.  
You can find default
config [here](https://github.com/lukaskabc/SimpleCustomEarlyLoading/blob/main/src/main/resources/default_config.json).

In the configuration you can specify elements.
Each element is one static image.
You need to specify the type of coordinates (`absolute` or `percentage`).
Note that the image size might be different on different displays, so you probably want to use percentage.

Percentage values should be from range [0; 100].
You need to specify coordinates for two corners of the image (top left and bottom right).

The default config contains an example of background (stretched to the whole window) -
it is a screenshot from the game with the [stellarview](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView) mod.  
Second element is an image created with [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/)
with [text generator plugin](https://www.blockbench.net/plugins/mc_text_generator).

The image size is 654x152 pixels.
Assuming the window size is FullHD 1920x1080, then one percentage for that is 1920/100 = 19.2 and 1080/100 = 10.8.
Then the size of the image scaled to 75% in percentage is `654 * 0.75 / 19.2 = 25.55` and `152 * 0.75 / 10.8 = 10.55`.
X coordinates: Image positioned in the middle (50%) has coordinates from `50 - 25.55 / 2 = 37.225` (x1) to
`50 + 25.55 / 2 = 62.775` (x2).
Y coordinates: Image position at 55% from the top has coordinates from `55` (y1) to `55 + 10.55 = 65.55` (y2).
